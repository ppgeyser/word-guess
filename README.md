# word-guess

This hangman/word guess game is my first project working with javascript/jquery for the UCSD Full Stack Web Developer Bootcamp. This project showcases my understanding of variables, arrays, functions, onclick/onkey events, usage of the math.random function, and manipulating the DOM. I also used what I learned in our html and css sections to create a game that is aesthetically pleasing visually and is responsive.
